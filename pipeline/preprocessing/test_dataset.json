[{"answer": "The neuron is the basic working unit of the brain, a specialized cell designed to transmit information to other nerve cells, muscle, or gland cells. Neurons are cells within the nervous system that transmit information to other nerve cells, muscle, or gland cells. Most neurons have a cell body, an axon, and dendrites.", "question": "What is a neuron?"}, {"answer": "The formation of new episodic memories requires the medial temporal lobe, a structure that includes the hippocampus. Without the medial temporal lobe, one is able to form new procedural memories (such as playing the piano) but cannot remember the events during which they happened (See the hippocampus and memory).", "question": "What is the role of the hippocampus in episodic memory?"}, {"answer": "The nervous system is the part of an animal that coordinates its actions by transmitting signals to and from different parts of its body. The nervous system detects environmental changes that impact the body, then works in tandem with the endocrine system to respond to such events.At the cellular level, the nervous system is defined by the presence of a special type of cell, called the neuron, also known as a \"nerve cell\"", "question": "What is the nervous system?"}, {"answer": "Neuroscience (or neurobiology) is the scientific study of the nervous system. It is a multidisciplinary branch of biology that combines physiology, anatomy, molecular biology, developmental biology, cytology, mathematical modeling and psychology to understand the fundamental and emergent properties of neurons and neural circuits. The scope of neuroscience has broadened over time to include different approaches used to study the nervous system at different scales and the techniques used by neuroscientists have expanded enormously, from molecular and cellular studies of individual neurons to imaging of sensory, motor and cognitive tasks in the brain", "question": "what is neuroscience?"}, {"answer": "The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate      and most invertebrate animals. The brain is located in the head,    usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision.    The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body.     In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 14 16 billion neurons,     and the estimated number of neurons in the cerebellum is 5570 billion.", "question": "what is the brain?"}, {"answer": "A motor neuron (or motoneuron) is a neuron whose cell body is located in the motor cortex, brainstem or the spinal cord, and whose axon (fiber) projects to the spinal cord or outside of the spinal cord to directly or indirectly control effector organs, mainly muscles and glands.", "question": "what is a motor neuron?"}, {"answer": "A reflex, or reflex action, is an involuntary and nearly instantaneous movement in response to a stimulus. A reflex is made possible by neural pathways called reflex arcs which can act on an impulse before that impulse reaches the brain. The reflex is then an automatic response to a stimulus that does not receive or need conscious thought.", "question": "what is a reflex?"}, {"answer": "The neocortex, also called the neopallium and isocortex, is the part of the mammalian brain involved in higherorder brain functions such as sensory perception, cognition, generation of motor commands, spatial reasoning and language. In the human brain, the neocortex is the largest part of the cerebral cortex which is the outer layer of the cerebrum, with the allocortex making up the rest. The neocortex is made up of six layers, labelled from the outermost inwards, I to VI.", "question": "what is the neocortex?"}, {"answer": "Neurotransmission, is the process by which signaling molecules called neurotransmitters are released by the axon terminal of a neuron (the presynaptic neuron), and bind to and react with the receptors on the dendrites of another neuron (the postsynaptic neuron). A similar process occurs in retrograde neurotransmission, where the dendrites of the postsynaptic neuron release retrograde neurotransmitters (e.g., endocannabinoids) that signal through receptors that are located on the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron, mainly at GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses.", "question": "what is neurotransmission?"}, {"answer": "Neuroplasticity, also known as brain plasticity, neuroelasticity, or neural plasticity, is the ability of the brain to change continuously throughout an individual's life, e.g., brain activity associated with a given function can be transferred to a different location, the proportion of grey matter can change, and synapses may strengthen or weaken over time. The aim of neuroplasticity is to optimize the neural networks during phylogenesis, ontogeny, and physiological learning, as well as after a brain injury. Research in the latter half of the 20th century showed that many aspects of the brain can be altered (or are \"plastic\") even through adulthood. However, the developing brain exhibits a higher degree of plasticity than the adult brain.", "question": "what is neural plasticity?"}, {"answer": "Cortical maps are collections (areas) of minicolumns in the brain cortex that have been identified as performing a specific information processing function (texture maps, color maps, contour maps, etc).Cortical organization, especially for the sensory systems, is often described in terms of maps. For example, sensory information from the foot projects to one cortical site and the projections from the hand target in another site. As the result of this somatotopic organization of sensory inputs to the cortex, cortical representation of the body resembles a map (or homunculus).", "question": "what is the cortical map?"}, {"answer": "The somatosensory system is a part of the sensory nervous system. The somatosensory system is a complex system of sensory neurons and pathways that responds to changes at the surface or inside the body. The axons (as afferent nerve fibers) of sensory neurons connect with, or respond to, various receptor cells. These sensory receptor cells are activated by different stimuli such as heat and nociception, giving a functional name to the responding sensory neuron, such as a thermoreceptor which carries information about temperature changes. Other types include mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and nociceptors which send signals along a sensory nerve to the spinal cord where they may be processed by other sensory neurons and then relayed to the brain for further processing. Sensory receptors are found all over the body including the skin, epithelial tissues, muscles, bones and joints, internal organs, and the cardiovascular system.", "question": "what is the somatosensory system?"}, {"answer": "The supramarginal gyrus is part of the somatosensory association cortex, which interprets tactile sensory data and is involved in perception of space and limbs location. It is also involved in identifying postures and gestures of other people, and is thus a part of the mirror neuron system.The righthemisphere supramarginal gyrus appears to play a central role in controlling our empathy towards other people. When this structure isn't working properly or when we have to make very quick judgments, our empathy becomes severely limited. Research has shown that disrupting the neurons in the right supramarginal gyrus causes humans to project our emotions on others, inhibiting our ability to be empathetic. In addition, this disruption also causes people to be more egocentric, mainly because they aren't able to perceive the emotions of those around them. Both the left and right supramarginal gyri of healthy, righthanded individuals are shown to be active when making phonological word choices. Individuals who had lesions to the left hemisphere had more difficulty than those with lesions to the right hemisphere, reinforcing the dominance of the left hemisphere in language.", "question": "what is the function of the supramarginal gyrus?"}, {"answer": "A mirror neuron is a neuron that fires both when an animal acts and when the animal observes the same action performed by another. Thus, the neuron \"mirrors\" the behavior of the other, as though the observer were itself acting. Such neurons have been directly observed in primate species.", "question": "what is a mirror neuron?"}, {"answer": "Physicians use fMRI to assess how risky brain surgery or similar invasive treatment is for a patient and to learn how a normal, diseased or injured brain is functioning. They map the brain with fMRI to identify regions linked to critical functions such as speaking, moving, sensing, or planning. This is useful to plan for surgery and radiation therapy of the brain. Clinicians also use fMRI to anatomically map the brain and detect the effects of tumors, stroke, head and brain injury, or diseases such as Alzheimer's, and developmental disabilities such as Autism etc.", "question": "what is the purpose of a functional magnetic resonance imaging?"}, {"answer": "By definition, immediate memory is the routine ability to hold ongoing experiences in mind for fractions of a second. The capacity of immediate memory is very large and each sensory modality (visual, verbal, tactile, and so on) appears to have its own memory register.", "question": "what is immediate memory?"}, {"answer": "Humans have at least two qualitatively different systems of information storage,     which are generally referred to as declarative memory and nondeclarative memory.     Declarative memory is the storage (and retrieval) of material that is available to consciousness and can be expressed by language (hence, \"declarative\").     Examples of declarative memory are the ability to remember a telephone number, a song, or the images of some past event.     Nondeclarative memory (sometimes referred to as procedural memory), on the other hand, is not available to consciousness, at least not in any detail. Such memories involve skills and associations that are, by and large, acquired and retrieved at an unconscious level.", "question": "what types of information storage systems do humans have?"}, {"answer": "Learning is the name given to the process by which new information is acquired by the nervous system and is observable through changes in behavior.", "question": "what is learning?"}, {"answer": "Another example of adult plasticity under hormonal control is the altered connections between cells of the female rat hypothalamus after giving birth. In females prior to pregnancy, the relevant hypothalamic neurons are isolated from each other by thin astrocytic processes. Under the influence of the hormonal environment prevailing during birth and lactation, the glial processes retract and the oxytocin and vasopressinsecreting neurons become electrically coupled by gap junctions ", "question": "what example can be given for neuroplasticity?"}, {"answer": "The process by which neurons are generated is generally referred to as neurogenesis. The time at which neurogenesis occurs for any particular neuron is called its neuronal \"birthdate.\" ", "question": "what is neurogenesis?"}, {"answer": "A special property of the cone system is color vision. Perceiving color allows humans (and many other animals) to discriminate objects on the basis of the distribution of the wavelengths of light that they reflect to the eye. While differences in luminance (i.e., overall light intensity) are often sufficient to distinguish objects, color adds another perceptual dimension that is especially useful when differences in luminance are subtle or nonexistent. Color obviously gives us a quite different way of perceiving and describing the world we live in.", "question": "what is one of the main functions of cones?"}, {"answer": "Following a painful stimulus associated with tissue damage, stimuli in the area of the injury and the surrounding region that would ordinarily be perceived as slightly painful are perceived as significantly more so, a phenomenon referred to as hyperalgesia. A good example of hyperalgesia is the increased sensitivity to temperature that occurs after a sunburn. This effect is due to changes in neuronal sensitivity that occur at the level of peripheral receptors as well as their central targets.", "question": "what is hyperalgesia?"}, {"answer": "Several amino acids fulfi ll most of the criteria for consideration as neurotransmitters. The best studied of these are gaminobutyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory transmitter in brain, and glutamate, which is the major excitatory transmitter in brain. Many of the principles concerning transmitter synthesis and inactivation that were previously discussed apply to amino acid transmitters, however there are some key differences between the amino acid and other classical transmitters.", "question": "what aminoacids can act as neurotransmitters?"}]
