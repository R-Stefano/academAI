[{"answer": "The brain has receptors for many hormones; for example, the metabolic hormones insulin, insulin-like growth factor, ghrelin, and leptin. These hormones are taken up from the blood and act to affect neuronal activity and certain aspects of neuronal structure.", "question": "what hormones affect the brain?"}, {"answer": "Estradiol induces nerve growth factor, which promotes survival of neurons important for learning and memory. Estradiol promotes activity in motor and motivational brain regions, and maintains the survival of neurons known to degenerate in Parkinson's disease. In the absence of estradiol, these functions are lost.", "question": "How does estrogen affect the brain?"}, {"answer": "Synapses are composed of three main parts: The presynaptic ending that contains neurotransmitters. The synaptic cleft between the two nerve cells. The postsynaptic ending that contains receptor sites.", "question": "What are the three components of the synapse?"}, {"answer": "In general, the left hemisphere of the brain is responsible for language and speech and is called the \"dominant\" hemisphere. The right hemisphere plays a large part in interpreting visual information and spatial processing.", "question": "Which part of the brain is responsible for speech?"}, {"answer": "Deep inside the medial temporal lobe is the region of the brain known as the limbic system, which includes the hippocampus, the amygdala, the cingulate gyrus, the thalamus, the hypothalamus, the epithalamus, the mammillary body and other organs, many of which are of particular relevance to the processing of memory.", "question": "which area of the brain controls memory?"}, {"answer": "The cerebrum.

Newton observed that color is not inherent in objects. Rather, the surface of an object reflects some colors and absorbs all the others. We perceive only the reflected colors.", "question": "How do our brains perceive color?"}, {"answer": "The human brain is relatively large and very wrinkled. Wrinkles increase the surface area for neurons. A folded brain surface has a greater surface area which means a greater power for processing information, but it's not entirely clear what factors determine the iconic shape of gyri and sulci in the human brain.", "question": "Why is the brain wrinkled?"}, {"answer": "Mature, differentiated neurons do not divide (undergo mitosis), but apparently there is a small population of self-renewing neural stem cells in adults that can produce new neurons. Neurogenesis predominantly occurs in the subventricular and subgranular zones of the brain.", "question": "How frequently do human neurons divide?"}, {"answer": "Sustained aerobic exercise increases adult neurogenesis in brain. Summary: It may be possible to increase the neuron reserve of the hippocampus and thus improve preconditions for learning by promoting neurogenesis via sustained aerobic exercise such as running, say researchers.", "question": "Does exercise cause neurogenesis?"}, {"answer": "Neurons selectively alter the permeability of their membranes to ions by opening and closing gated ion channels in the membrane. Movement of Cl- into a neuronal cell would make a neuron (more or less) likely to fire an action potential.", "question": "how do neurons alter their membrane potential?"}, {"answer": "In the average neuron, the resting membrane potential is approximately -70mv and the threshold potential is around -55mv. That means the membrane potential usually needs to become more positive by +15mv for an action potential to fire. Furthermore, the threshold changes immediately following an action potential.", "question": "Does threshold potential change?"}, {"answer": "Neural accommodation. Neural accommodation or neuronal accommodation occurs when a neuron or muscle cell is depolarised by slowly rising current (ramp depolarisation) in vitro.", "question": "What causes neural accommodation?"}, {"answer": "Plaques and tangles stop communication between nerve cells and cause them to die.

A bridge between the nervous system and the endocrine system, which regulates hormones in the body, the hypothalamus also controls body temperature and is responsible for sensations of hunger and thirst.", "question": "Which part of the brain regulates body temperature?"}, {"answer": " Fainting usually is caused by a temporary drop in blood pressure. During that brief drop, the brain does not get the blood flow that it needs - and you lose consciousness. Some seizures produce dramatic shaking movements and loss of consciousness for longer than most fainting spells", "question": "Can fainting cause memory loss?"}, {"answer": "Sometimes severe seizure can cause brain damage, but most seizures do not seem to have a detrimental effect on the brain. Epilepsy has many possible causes, from illness to brain damage to abnormal brain development. ... Generalized seizure symptoms may cause loss of consciousness, falls, or massive muscle spasms.", "question": "Do seizures cause damage to the brain?"}, {"answer": "During a seizure, there are bursts of electrical activity in your brain, sort of like an electrical storm. This activity causes different symptoms depending on the type of seizure and what part of the brain is involved. Also, in some seizures, parts of the brain can still function normally while others can't.", "question": "What happens to your brain after a seizure?"}, {"answer": "Classical conditioning is a form of learning whereby a conditioned stimulus (CS) becomes associated with an unrelated unconditioned stimulus (US) in order to produce a behavioral response known as a conditioned response (CR).
