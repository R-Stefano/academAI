Copyright Annual ReviewsThe last decade has seen dramatic technological and conceptual changes in research on episodic memory and the brain. New technologies, and increased use of more naturalistic observations, have enabled investigators to delve deeply into the structures that mediate episodic memory, particularly the hippocampus, and to track functional and structural interactions among brain regions that support it. Conceptually, episodic memory is increasingly being viewed as subject to lifelong transformations that are reflected in the neural substrates that mediate it. In keeping with this dynamic perspective, research on episodic memory (and the hippocampus) has infiltrated domains, from perception to language and from empathy to problem solving, that were once considered outside its boundaries. Using the component process model as a framework, and focusing on the hippocampus, its subfields, and specialization along its longitudinal axis, along with its interaction with other brain regions, we consider these new developments and their implications for the organization of episodic memory and its contribution to functions in other domains.The concept of episodic memory, according to Tulving's formulation still governs much of the research on episodic memory and the brain, but the introduction of new topics, modes of inquiry, more naturalistic approaches and technologies has added great variety to the landscape. It is this altered landscape that we wish to capture in our review. Because it is considered central to our understanding of the brain basis of episodic memory, the hippocampus (HPC) serves as the hub of our article, much as it is considered the hub of regions dealing with episodic memory. The article focuses on four parts: (a) the role the HPC plays in representing the various aspects and attributes of episodic memory; (b) other structures that are implicated in different aspects of episodic memory and its transformation to gist and semantics; (c) the contribution of the HPC and episodic memory to nonepisodic memory functions such as priming, short-term memory (STM), and semantics and to nonmnemonic functions such as perception, problem solving, decision making, and language; and finally, and briefly, (d ) the functional and structural connectivity between the HPC and other regions and networks implicated in episodic memory.In the interest of space and timeliness, we favored the most recent references and reviews over early empirical papers.

We regret that owing to space limitations we could not cover in detail, and sometimes not at all, many topics relevant to episodic memory, such as emotion, reward, individual differences, and lifespan development.Hassabis This framework focuses primarily on representational inputs to the HPC from the posterior neocortex, and it says nothing about HPC connections to anterior structures such as the amygdala (emotion), anterior temporal cortex (semantics), and PFC [schemas and working memory (WM)]. These structures play different, but important, roles in episodic memory through their interaction with the HPC. We will pay some attention below to the relation of the HPC to the ventromedial PFC The HPC creates the same kind of representation throughout its length, but at different scales. At the posterior end, its representations capture detailed information about local spatiotemporal aspects of an experienced event based on input from the posterior neocortex. At the anterior end, its representations capture global aspects of an event (i.e., the general context and the emotion and meaning attached to it) based also on interactions with the anterior neocortex. Thus, these two types of HPC representation arise primarily from differences in input-output connections along the long axis of the HPC As Not all components of the HPC nor of the neocortical (and other) structures with which they interact are activated at the same time or in all tasks. Instead, we conceive of subsets of components forming temporary process-specific alliances (PSAs) whose composition is determined by the moment-to-moment demands of a task. Whereas the posterior neocortical components, in conjunction with the posterior hippocampus (pHPC), determine the local, spatio-perceptual aspects of the experience, anterior components of the HPC, in conjunction with the anterior temporal lobe, PFC, and amygdala, represent conceptual and emotional aspects. The PSAs also include control structures that regulate encoding and retrieval. All these memory components can interact with components earlier and later in the hierarchy, and in other domains, such as language, planning, and decision making, leading to the involvement of the HPC, and by inference episodic memory, in nonmnemonic functions (see below).The updated component process model makes the following assumptions:During perception, sensory information is progressively bound into feature clusters in early sensory regions, into integrated objects and contexts in late sensory and cortical MTL regions, and into complex events binding objects with their spatiotemporal contexts together with the feeling (phenomenology) of experience in the HPC.The same regions remain active for a while due to top-down modulation from the PFC, which allows the persistence of object and context representations, as well as unified event representations, within WM.During encoding, a fraction of transient representations in WM are transformed to a long-lasting format in the cortex and HPC. The HPC representation points to the location of cortical memory traces (HPCcortex PSA). This encoding process is supported by schematic relational processes in the vmPFC [aHPC-vmPFC PSA; anterior hippocampus (aHPC)] and semantic processes in the ventrolateral PFC (vlPFC) (vlPFC-MTL PSA) and anterior temporal cortex.Finally, during retrieval, access to the integrated event representation in HPC leads to the reactivation of the MTL and posterior cortices, hence to cortical memory traces (HPC-cortex PSA) (stage 1) and to the awareness of the recovered memories, involving regions such as the ventral parietal cortex (VPC) (HPC-VPC PSA) (stage 2). As in the case of encoding processes, these retrieval processes are supported by control processes mediated by the PFC. Oscillatory mechanisms are assumed to contribute to all these four groups of processes.It is generally agreed that patients with extensive bilateral damage manifest a global anterograde amnesia that affects acquisition, retention, and retrieval of all episodic memories. This includes the particular details of the event as well as its theme and general structure, though it is the episodic details that are most severely affected. When damage is more restricted, confined to small portions of the HPC, or unilateral, the relative sparing of acquisition of gist and semantic memory compared to episodic memory is more noticeable To measure these aspects of autobiographical memory retrieval, In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of autobiographical memory, HPC activation has been shown to be modulated by the number of details or the vividness of the recalled autobiographical event, which is correlated with internal details Film clips provide more experimental control than tests of autobiographical memory, yet they retain a naturalistic quality. The pattern of results obtained with clips in patients with MTL lesions With respect to performance in patients with MTL lesions that include the HPC, As we noted earlier, recollection, mediated by the HPC, depends on relational yet flexible associations among disparate (random) and distinct (separable) elements (for reviews, see Because all autobiographical events unfold in a particular spatial context, it has been argued that spatial context has a privileged status in episodic memory, consistent with the HPC's role in spatial memory and navigation There is evidence that memory for events is facilitated by familiar spatial information (e.g., Time is a central aspect of episodic memory. Events unfold in time just as they unfold in space. However, evidence for a hippocampal role in forming, maintaining, and retrieving temporal associations, as well as relating them to events, is controversial: Some consider time to be a derived property, whereas others consider temporal coding to be a core function or property of the HPC (Dalla There are at least three aspects of temporal processing that have been addressed in the literature To account for the first two aspects, based on evidence from time cells Memory for duration and temporal order across very short intervals such as milliseconds, and across long intervals such as minutes, hours, or days, seems to depend on information and strategies mediated by extrahippocampal structures Although there is ample evidence that relational associations account for our ability to recollect the details of an episode, a number of studies suggest that the precision, or high resolution, of those memories is a critical component even for recognition of single items such as faces, as long as the items are complex and the targets are distinguished from similar lures after a long delay Recent advances in high-resolution fMRI have allowed investigators to test these ideas more directly. The same involvement of HPC subfields is evident in distinguishing among more naturalistic stimuli. Precision of episodic recall of film clips, as measured by the extent to which participants could rate the clips as different, was related to the size and activity of the CA3 region By contrast, CA1 is presumed to collate information generated through pattern completion in CA3 and to deliver it back to the entorhinal cortex after having compared it with the current perceptual input. CA1, therefore, can act as a match-mismatch detector and facilitate the laying down of new memories and retrieval of old ones The distribution of the hippocampal subfields is not uniform along the longitudinal axis The evidence generally supports the model (see With respect to autobiographical memory, our framework has much in common with Such differences are also observed when considering global and local aspects of a single object. The neural suppression that occurs when an object is repeated is seen in the DG/CA3 subfields of the aHPC, but when fine discrimination between targets and similar lures is required, then the pHPC is activated Similarly, encoding novel events, or forming relational associations between random items, is associated with aHPC activation, possibly because such activities typically involve higherorder conceptual processing, whereas encoding familiar or repeated events relies less on such conceptual processes and more on attending to perceptual aspects of the event The global-local hypothesis of anterior-posterior HPC organization that we propose provides a plausible first approximation of functional organization along the long axis of the HPC with respect to episodic memory. Another virtue of this conception of aHPC function is that it serves as a bridge between detailed episodic representations that are dependent on the HPC and more schematic, gist-like representations that emerge as memories are transformed with time and experience Episodic memory is dynamic, with significant transformations occurring throughout the memory's lifetime Studies of postencoding consolidation indicate that different processes are predictive of better memory for the studied material, such as a spike in HPC activity immediately after the end of an event (Ben-Yakov & Dudai 2011), event-specific reactivation of encoding processes during rest Postencoding processes during sleep have complex effects on memories acquired during the previous day, and recent work suggests that their impact may be related to the type of memory examined as well as to the stages of sleep under study The issue of memory transformation lies at the heart of the debate on the neural representation of remote memory, in which changes can occur across weeks, years, and even decades Drawing on the work of previous investigators, Building on ideas from multiple trace theory, Appealing to the principle of F-NI, The debate between adherents of each camp has continued for 20 years and has been reviewed extensively, so it will only be summarized here. Performance on tests of autobiographical memory that are especially sensitive to attributes that capture the essence of episodic memory-such as perceptual details, viewpoint specificity, vividness, judgments of recollection, and relational associations-suffers after HPC damage or dysfunction, regardless of etiology and of the amount of time passed since the memory was acquired.Unless the damage extends to extra-HPC regions, memories for gist or semantic aspects of personal experiences, public events, and well-known narratives such as bible stories and fairy tales are relatively well preserved Evidence from fMRI is consistent with this observation. Autobiographical memories that are detailed and vivid engage the HPC no matter how long ago they were acquired The same pattern of decreasing HPC and increasing neocortical activation with remoteness and accompanying loss of specificity or recollection is found in traditional laboratory tests of episodic memory with delays of one Proponents of the SCT argue that extensive retrograde amnesia for autobiographical events occurs only when lesions of the MTL extend beyond the HPC to include the temporal neocortex The most unequivocal evidence comes from studies of context-dependent (episodic) and context-independent (gist-like) memory in rodents, where considerable control can be exerted over the learning environment and over lesion location and extent. These data favor the transformation hypothesis. Longitudinal studies show a loss of contextual specificity of memories tested a month after acquisition compared to tests given shortly after learning These findings provide a possible interpretation of system reconsolidation, a process whereby memories that once were believed to be consolidated in extra-HPC structures become labile once they are reactivated by a reminder (retrieval cue) and become vulnerable once again to the disruptive effects of HPC lesions, protein synthesis inhibitors, or synaptic interference The fact that specificity and hippocampal dependence could be restored by reminders not only speaks to the dynamic nature of memory and against the SCT, but also suggests that some vestige of the original specific memory must be retained by the HPC. Evidence in support of this hypothesis comes from optogenetic studies in which temporary disruption of those CA1 cells that encoded the information leads to loss of contextual fear memories even at long delays The vmPFC seems to play a special role in mediating remote memories Such results are interpreted according to a schema modification model Some investigators have suggested that the vmPFC is the consolidated (remote) memory homologue of the HPC, taking over its function. This notion runs counter to the F-NI principle. Our proposal is that the vmPFC and HPC may both deal with context, but of fundamentally different sorts. The HPC binds together local and global contextual information about a specific event or environment, whereas the vmPFC binds together what is common across similar events and possibly helps "decide" which among them is relevant for a particular task A number of predictions follow from this hypothesis:Insofar as retrieval is dependent on the vmPFC without HPC involvement, the retrieved memory will be gist-like or general, rather than detailed and specific. This appears to be the case in humans and rodents with HPC damage.The vmPFC should interact with the aHPC to encode schematic information and to help retrieve detailed information via schema-related cues (for similar proposals, see Damage to the vmPFC, therefore, should be more evident in tests of remote, rather than recent, memory, and vary inversely with the specificity of retrieval cues.The vmPFC may be implicated more as structured events are transformed or when isolated events are experienced within a structured context, as in Following vmPFC damage, schema formation and representation may itself be impaired, so that what delineates a schema (e.g., what one does in a kitchen) is distorted, nebulous, or overinclusive Memories for recent events draw on interactions between schemas, semantics, and perceptual aspects of an experience, mediated in part by different regions in the anterior and posterior neo-cortex. These are bound together in relational representations mediated by the pHPC for local details and the aHPC for global context, accounting for the specificity characteristic of episodic memory Consciousness is a defining feature of episodic memory, as evidenced by the fact that performance on a variety of implicit or nondeclarative tests can be normal in patients with MTL damage and severe episodic memory deficits The two-stage model of recollection predicts that priming for relational associations should be preserved insofar as it draws on information underlying the first rapid, nonconscious stage of recollection mediated by the HPC. Recent studies show that priming of relational associations, measured by manual reaction times Consistent with our component process model, studies on nonconscious memory suggest that engagement of the HPC is not sufficient for explicit recollection or episodic memory, and that other structures also need to be recruited. Structures in the frontoparietal network are among the possible candidates. Here we focus on the PPC, since it has been the object of much debate concerning its role in episodic memory.Activation of the PPC, particularly on the left, often accompanies memory retrieval on laboratory tests of recognition and autobiographical memory These findings suggest a dissociation between successful retrieval of the content of episodic memories and the phenomenological experience that accompanies successful retrieval. It remains to be determined whether the diminished autonoetic consciousness associated with VPC and PFC damage or disconnection results from an impaired postretrieval process that, as part of the second stage of recollection, attributes phenomenological experience to a detailed memory, or whether it results from loss of the "consciousness feature" of the HPCneocortical engram, which VPC codes much as inferior temporal structures code for perceptual features.Following the introduction of the concept of episodic memory in 1972, much research has focused on how to distinguish episodic memory from other cognitive functions in general, and in particular from other forms of memory, at both the functional and neural levels. Given the widespread connections of the HPC The idea that the HPC sits at the end of a perceptual hierarchy, receiving input from lower levels and projecting back to them, suggests that HPC influence should be felt in perception and WM, thereby eroding the hard and fast distinction between long-term memory (LTM), perception, and WM. According to the hierarchical representation model (HRM; Drawing on their theory stating that the HPC is implicated in scene construction, HPC has also been shown to be implicated in STM and WM, especially if precision and relational binding are required Though such developments blur the boundaries between LTM, WM, and perception, obliterating them would obscure the striking differences one sees clinically: Patients with HPC lesions rarely complain of perceptual or WM deficits but always complain of episodic memory deficits, whereas the reverse is true of people with damage to levels that are lower in the hierarchy. Capitalizing on this observation, Squire and collaborators (e.g., To counter this negative evidence, and the arguments based on it, Yonelinas (2013) and One of the most striking findings in recent years points to the large overlap in processes and structures involved in retrieving episodic memories, imagining future personal events, and constructing scenes, thereby propelling the HPC into domains it had not occupied previously Recent studies have shown that episodic simulation can lead to better social problem solving Episodic simulation also influences decision making, as illustrated on tests of temporal discounting (i.e., the tendency to discount rewards if they are delayed). Whereas episodic simulation depends on conscious processes, unconscious stage-one associative processes mediated by the HPC likely underlie performance on tests of associative inference. In such tests, participants are shown overlapping pairs of items (e.g., AB and BC) and learn to associate A with C though they never co-occur. Similar processes may underlie performance on tests of second-order conditioning in rats ) and transitive inference in rats and humans who are presented with overlapping stimulus pairs in which one member of the pair is rewarded (e.g., A > B, B > C, C > D) and participants must infer how it is related to the other items Such effects cannot be said to be related to full-blown episodic memory, which is defined as being associated with autonoetic consciousness, but should rather be related to operations of pattern separation, pattern completion, and associative binding that operate outside of conscious awareness but presumably underlie both episodic memory and these types of associative learning, in accord with the two-stage model of recollection and HPC activation. Consistent with this observation, Language processing was considered to be preserved in amnesia, at least as far as core phonological, syntactic, and semantic aspects were concerned As with language, insofar as semantic memory is informed by detailed, precise information about autobiographical events and allocentric spatial representations, it will be influenced by episodic memory representations mediated by the HPC. Evidence from studies of patients with amnesia and with semantic dementia suggests that people, places, public events, and even common objects and their names can be imbued with autobiographical significance (AS) in the sense that they automatically (either with or without conscious awareness) conjure up recollective information that facilitates naming, recognition, and semantic judgments. Consistent with the component process model, this AS advantage is lost in people with MTL damage (for review, see These sets of findings suggest a novel interpretation of reports by Quiroga and collaborators (see review in Quiroga 2012), who found that single cells in the human HPC, which they named concept cells, respond selectively and invariantly to representations of famous people across modalities. The contribution of HPC-mediated episodic memory processes is also evident in tests of semantic fluency. Impaired performance on tests of semantic fluency following temporal lobe lesions has been shown to be related to HPC damage and not exclusively to lateral temporal damage as was once believed Although previously acquired semantic memory, stripped of episodic aspects, can be relatively spared in HPC patients, the acquisition of new vocabulary, though possible without the HPC, is laborious and poor (see The evidence we reviewed indicates that episodic memory, as mediated by the HPC, contributes more to language and semantics than classical views on dissociable multiple memory systems would lead us to believe. As with perception and WM, we do not wish to end by obliterating distinctions that we believe are still useful; rather, based on our component process model, we propose that the systems are much more interactive than we once thought, enabling episodic memory and the HPC to influence functions outside their traditional domain. This interactive approach is increasingly evident in neuroimaging research, with its current emphasis on networks and on structural and functional connectivity among nodes in those networks.The individual brain regions discussed in the previous sections cannot support episodic memory unless they interact with each other and with other regions. In functional neuroimaging studies, these interactions can be indirectly measured as covariation in activity, or functional connectivity. Functional connectivity can be investigated at the level of large-scale networks, such as the default mode network (Andrews-Hanna 2012), or at the level of small networks that are assembled to mediate a specific cognitive operation and rapidly disassembled when the operation is no longer needed. To postulate one of these PSAs The first example is the PSA between the pHPC and VPC during recollective retrieval. Consistent with the first criterion, meta-analyses of event-related fMRI studies have strongly linked these regions to retrieval success and recollection Another example is the PSA between the HPC and domain-specific posterior cortices during encoding and retrieval. Consistent with the first criterion, activity in domain-specific cortices has been associated with successful encoding of relevant stimuli and with the reactivation of this information during retrieval Finally, the HPC and domain-specific cortices are anatomically linked, and there is evidence that they are functionally connected during rest Given that PSAs are rapidly assembled and disassembled, they require a mechanism that can quickly control communication between distant brain regions, and the most likely candidate is neuronal oscillations. There is abundant evidence that oscillations, particularly those in gamma (40-100 Hz) and theta (4-8 Hz) frequencies, control PSAs during episodic encoding and retrieval During retrieval, access to a fraction of the HPC representation of the original event is assumed to cause reinstatement of the associated theta cycle, which triggers the reinstatement of the nested gamma cycles and their associated cortical representations In sum, the HPC can only support episodic memory if it interacts very closely with other regions. Each episodic process is mediated by a transient collaboration between regions mediating complementary operations, or PSA, consistent with our component process model. PSAs require a mechanism that can rapidly turn on and off interactions among distant regions, such as neural oscillations in gamma and theta frequencies Since its inception, the scientific study of memory has been influenced by the research program of its pioneers.
